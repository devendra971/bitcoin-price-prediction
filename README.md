# PREDICTION-OF-BITCOIN-PRICES-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

The Project is in the partial fulfillment of course Machine Learning course at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) 


The availability of vast amounts of data and sophisticated machine learning algorithms have made it possible to create models that can provide reasonably accurate prediction
Our Machine learning models are trained to predict future Bitcoin prices by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns.

## The Problem
Cryptocurrencies are the most volatile markets today and has gained a lot of attentions form young investors around the globe. Cryptocurrency being a novel technique for transaction system, has been an unpredictable price fluctuation behavior. This led to a lot of confusion among the investor to invest their money in new era currencies or not. The bitcoin is said to be the most sought cryptocurrency is highly volatile as mere whisper on social media, market has significant affects on the prices of cryptocurrencies. The goal of this project is to predict prices for bitcoin using machine learning techniques for the next day and to maximize the gains of the investors. 

KEYWORDS : Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Modelâ€‹(ARIMA), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), long short-term memory networks(LSTM)

## Data Source: 
Data used in this project is a real time data that we get from the `cmcscraper`. cmcscraper is a Python package that is primarily used for scraping cryptocurrency market data from the `CoinMarketCap` (CMC) API.
